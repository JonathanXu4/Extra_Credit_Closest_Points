The Closest Points program is ran using the following command on the command line. It is built on Java version 17.0.2 and requires a similar installation to run:

```
java -jar c:\pathtojarfile.jar
```

When already in the same folder, this is:

```
java -jar closestPoints.jar
```

with both the closestPoints.jar file and points.txt file in the same folder
